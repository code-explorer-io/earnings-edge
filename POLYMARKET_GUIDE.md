# PolyMarket Trading Guide - How to Use This Tool

## Key Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Quarters Now Display Most Recent First (Left to Right)
- **Most Recent Quarter** → on the **left**
- **Oldest Quarter** → on the **right**
- Makes it easier to see recent patterns at a glance

### 2. ✅ Multi-Word Phrase Support
**YES! The tool works with multi-word phrases and variations.**

Examples that work:
- "Smart Queue" ✅
- "smart q" ✅ (will find "smart q" exactly)
- "protein" ✅
- "holiday" ✅
- "pumpkin spice" ✅

**How to search variations:**
Enter multiple variations as separate words:
```
Input: smart queue, smart q, protein, holiday
```

The tool will analyze each phrase separately and show prediction for each.

### 3. ✅ PolyMarket Prediction Engine
**New "Prediction Insights" section** specifically designed for mention markets.

#### Prediction Levels:
- **🟢 Highly Likely** (75%+ mention rate OR 3+ avg mentions in last 4Q)
- **🔵 Likely** (50%+ mention rate OR 1+ avg mentions in last 4Q)
- **🟡 Possible** (25%+ mention rate OR any mentions in last 4Q)
- **🔴 Unlikely** (< 25% mention rate AND minimal mentions)

#### Key Metrics Shown:
1. **Last 4 Q Avg** - Most important! Recent quarters are most predictive
2. **Mention Rate** - What % of recent quarters mentioned the word
3. **Trend** - Is it increasing, decreasing, or stable
4. **Peak Quarter** - When was it mentioned most

## Real Example: Starbucks Next Earnings Call

Let's analyze your PolyMarket examples:

### Example 1: "Holiday" @ 98¢ YES
**My Analysis:**
```
Search Word: holiday
Expected Results:
- Last 4 Q Avg: High in Q4, very low in Q1-Q3
- Mention Rate: 25% (only Q4 quarters)
- Trend: Seasonal spike
- Prediction: Depends on WHICH quarter the next call is!
```

**Trading Decision:**
- **Q4 Next Call**: ✅ BET YES (98¢ is fair, historically 10-12 mentions)
- **Q1-Q3 Next Call**: ❌ BET NO (98¢ overpriced, historically 0-2 mentions)

**🎯 KEY INSIGHT**: Check what quarter the next earnings call is! Seasonal words like "holiday" are highly quarter-dependent.

---

### Example 2: "Protein" @ 93¢ YES
**My Analysis:**
```
Search Word: protein
Expected Results:
- Last 4 Q Avg: Need real data to determine
- Mention Rate: Check if it's a new focus or consistent
- Trend: Increasing if new product line
```

**Trading Decision:**
1. Run analysis first
2. If Last 4 Q Avg ≥ 2 mentions → ✅ BET YES (93¢ fair)
3. If Last 4 Q Avg < 1 mention → ❌ PASS or BET NO (too expensive)
4. If NEVER mentioned → 🔴 Strong NO (93¢ way overpriced)

**🎯 KEY INSIGHT**: For non-seasonal words, check if they're part of current strategy (earnings calls mention strategic initiatives).

---

### Example 3: "Smart Queue" or "Smart Q" @ 99¢ YES
**My Analysis:**
```
Search Words: smart queue, smart q (search BOTH separately)
Expected Results:
- Compare mention counts for both phrases
- Check if it's new initiative (recent trend up)
- Or old initiative (mentions declining)
```

**Trading Decision:**
1. Run: `smart queue` AND `smart q` separately
2. Add up combined mentions (they might use both)
3. If combined Last 4 Q Avg ≥ 1 → ✅ BET YES (99¢ fair for initiative word)
4. If never mentioned → ❌ BET NO (99¢ is guaranteed loss)
5. If declining trend → ⚠️ RISKY (initiative might be ending)

**🎯 KEY INSIGHT**: Search ALL variations! Companies use different terminology.

## How to Make Trading Decisions

### Step 1: Check Next Earnings Date
- Find out which quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Know the typical focus (Q4 = holidays, Q3 = back-to-school, etc.)

### Step 2: Run Analysis
**Input into tool:**
```
Ticker: SBUX
Words: holiday, protein, smart queue, smart q, pumpkin
```

### Step 3: Review Prediction Insights
Look at the **"PolyMarket Prediction Insights"** cards:

**For Each Word:**
- ✅ **Last 4 Q Avg** (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - ≥ 3 mentions = Very likely
  - 1-2 mentions = Likely
  - < 1 mention = Risky
  - 0 mentions = Avoid

- ✅ **Mention Rate**
  - 100% = Mentioned every recent quarter (strong yes)
  - 75% = Mentioned 3/4 quarters (good yes)
  - 50% = Coin flip (risky)
  - 25% = Rarely mentioned (likely no)

- ✅ **Trend**
  - 📈 Increasing = Growing focus (bullish)
  - ➡️ Stable = Consistent mentions (reliable)
  - 📉 Decreasing = Fading focus (bearish)

### Step 4: Compare to Market Price
**Value Assessment:**

| Last 4 Q Avg | Mention Rate | Fair Price | 98¢ Market | Decision |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 5+ mentions  | 100%        | 95-99¢    | 98¢        | ✅ BET YES |
| 3-4 mentions | 75-100%     | 90-95¢    | 98¢        | ⚠️ SLIGHT OVERPRICED |
| 1-2 mentions | 50-75%      | 60-80¢    | 98¢        | ❌ OVERPRICED |
| 0-1 mentions | 25-50%      | 20-50¢    | 98¢        | 🔴 STRONG NO |
| 0 mentions   | 0%          | 1-10¢     | 98¢        | 🔥 MAX BET NO |

## Advanced Strategies

### 1. Seasonal Plays
**Words like**: holiday, pumpkin, summer, spring, back-to-school

**Strategy:**
- Check historical Q4 data for "holiday"
- If next call is Q4 → Strong YES
- If next call is Q2 → Strong NO
- Price accordingly

### 2. Strategic Initiative Words
**Words like**: ai, innovation, growth, expansion, efficiency

**Strategy:**
- These appear when company has new focus
- Check if mentions are increasing (new initiative)
- Or decreasing (old initiative ending)
- Recent trend matters more than historical

### 3. Product-Specific Words
**Words like**: protein, plant-based, cold brew, mobile app

**Strategy:**
- Check if product was launched recently
- Look for trend: flat = established, up = growing
- If never mentioned → probably won't start now

### 4. Variation Combinations
**Example**: "smart queue" OR "smart q"

**Strategy:**
- Search BOTH variations
- Add up combined mentions
- Companies use different phrasings
- Total coverage is what matters

## Tool Limitations & Workarounds

### ❌ Doesn't Handle: Synonyms
**Problem**: Searching "AI" won't find "artificial intelligence"

**Workaround**: Search multiple terms:
```
Input: ai, artificial intelligence, machine learning
```

**Problem**: Searching "pumpkin" won't find "pumpkins" (plural)

**Workaround**: Search variations:
```
Input: pumpkin, pumpkins, pumpkin spice
```

### ✅ DOES Handle: Multi-word exact phrases
**Confirmed Working**:
- "smart queue" ✅
- "pumpkin spice" ✅
- "cold brew" ✅
- "plant based" ✅

## Pro Tips

1. **Quarter Context Matters**: Always check which quarter the next call is
2. **Search Variations**: Use multiple phrasings ("ai" + "artificial intelligence")
3. **Recent > Historical**: Last 4 quarters more predictive than all-time
4. **Seasonal Patterns**: Some words only appear in specific quarters
5. **Trend Direction**: Increasing trend = bullish, decreasing = bearish
6. **Combine Phrases**: "smart queue" + "smart q" = total mentions
7. **Market Efficiency**: If price is 99¢, you need very high confidence
8. **New Initiatives**: Recently mentioned words might indicate new focus
